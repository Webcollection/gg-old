Etsy Hack Week project to make in-Javascript DSL for The Grammar of Graphics.

Some ideas of things to do next:

- Color and size scales.

- Implement positioners, especially for stacked and side-by-side bar charts.

- Facets.

- Coordinate systems (esp. pie charts)

- Regularize/rationalize/document use of CSS for controlling appearence.

- In-browser interactive graph builder. (REPL?)
