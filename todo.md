# TODOs

1. ensure shorthand mapping actually performs correctly
   somewhere in the workflow, the mapping is lost!  where do
   the mappings need to be established?

2. Support grouping and propogating mapped aesthetics down the
   workflow


1. allow aesthetics aliases

  color: "attr2"

  actually compiles to

  fill: "attr2"
  stroke: "attr2"
